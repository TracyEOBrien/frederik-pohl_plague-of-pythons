			<p>Floating. Floating; a jellyfish floating. Trailing tentacles that whipped and curled, floating over the sandbound claws and chitin that clashed beneath, floating over the world’s people, and them not even knowing, not even seeing.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>Chandler floated.</p>
			<p>He was up, out and away. He was drifting. Around him was no-color. He saw nothing of space or size, he only saw, or did not see but felt-smelled-tasted, people. They were the sandbound. They were the creatures that crawled and struggled below, and his tentacles lashed out at them.</p>
			<p>Beside him floated another. The girl? It had a shape, but not a human shape⁠—a pair of great projecting spheres, a cinctured area-rule shape. Female. Yes, undoubtedly the girl. It waved a member at him and he understood he was beckoned. He followed.</p>
			<p>Two of sandbound ones were ahead.</p>
			<p>The female shape slipped into one, he into the other. It was as easy to invest this form with his own will as it was to command the muscles of his hand. They looked at each other out of sandbound eyes. “You’re a boy!” Chandler laughed. The girl laughed: “You’re an old washerwoman!” They were in a kitchen where fish simmered on an electric stove. The boy-Rosie wrinkled his-her nose, blinked and was empty. Only the small almond-eyed boy was left, and he began to cry convulsively. Chandler understood. He floated out after her.</p>
			<p>This way, this way, she gestured. A crowd of mudbound figures. She slipped into one, he into another. They were in a bus now, rocking along an inland road, all men, all roughly dressed. Laborers going to clear a new section of Oahu of its split-level debris, Chandler thought, and looked for the girl in one of the men’s eyes, could not find her, hesitated and⁠—floated. She was hovering impatiently. This way!</p>

			<p>He followed, and followed.</p>
			<p>They were a hundred people doing a hundred things. They lingered a few moments as a teenage couple holding hands in the twilight of the beach. They fled from a room where Chandler was an old woman dying on a bed, and Rosalie a stolid, uncaring nurse beside her. They played follow-the-leader through the audience of a Honolulu movie theater, and sought each other, laughing, among the fish stalls of King Street. Then Chandler turned to Rosalie to speak and⁠ ⁠… it all went out⁠ ⁠… the scene disappeared⁠ ⁠… he opened his eyes, and he was back in his own flesh.</p>
			<p>He was lying on the pastel pile rug in Rosalie’s bedroom.</p>
			<p>He got up, rubbing the side of his face. He had tumbled, it seemed. Rosalie was lying on the bed.</p>
			<p>In a moment she opened her eyes.</p>
			<p>“Well, love?”</p>
			<p>He said hoarsely, “What made it stop?”</p>
			<p>She shrugged. “Koitska turned you off. Tired of monitoring us, I expect⁠—it’s been an hour. I’m surprised his patience lasted this long.”</p>
			<p>She stretched luxuriously, but he was too full of what had happened even to see the white grace of her body. “Did you like it, love? Would you like to have it forever?”</p>

			<p>For nine days Chandler’s status remained in limbo. He spent that day in a state of numb bemusement, remembering the men and women he had worn like garments, appalled and exhilarated. He did not see Rosalie again that day, she kept to her room and he locked out. He was still a lapdog, but a lapdog with a dream dangling before him. He went to sleep that night thinking that he was a dog who might become a god, and he had eight days left.</p>
			<p>The next day Rosalie wheedled another hour of the coronet from Koitska. They explored the ice caves on Mount Rainier in the bodies of two sick, starving hermits and wandered arm in arm near the destroyed International Bridge at Niagara, breathing the spray of the unchanging Falls. He had seven days left.</p>
			<p>They passed like a dream. He saw a great deal of the inner workings of the exec, more than before. He had privileges. He was up for membership in the club. Rosalie had proposed him. He talked with two Czechoslovakian ballet dancers in their persons, and a succession of heavily accented Russians and Poles and Japanese through the mouth of the beach boy who came to tend Rosalie’s garden. He thought they liked him and was pleased that he penetrated where he had not been allowed before⁠ ⁠… until he realized that these freedoms were in themselves a threat. They allowed him this contact so that they could look him over. If they rejected him they would have to kill him, because he had seen too much. But by then a week had passed, and another day, and though he did not know it he had only one day left. Rosalie did what she could to make the days of waiting easy for him.</p>
			<p>“Embarrassing, isn’t it? I went through it myself, love. Come have a drink.”</p>
			<p>“When will I know?” he demanded fretfully.</p>
			<p>“Well.” She hesitated. “I don’t suppose there’s any harm in telling you, love, under the circumstances⁠—”</p>
			<p>He knew what the circumstances were.</p>
			<p>“I guess I can tell you. You need just over seven hundred votes to come in. You’ve got⁠—” Her eyes glazed for a moment. She was looking through some clerk’s eyes, somewhere on the island. “You’ve got about a hundred and fifty so far. Takes time, doesn’t it? But it’s worth it in the end.”</p>
			<p>“How many ‘no’ votes?”</p>
			<p>“None.” She said gently, “You’ll never have but one, love, because that’s all it takes.”</p>
			<p>He stared. The girl gook took up his hand and kissed it lightly. “One blackball’s enough, yes, but never fear. Rosie’s on your side.”</p>
